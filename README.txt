Syd is a cross-platform instrument editor and software synthesizer by Jim Bumgardner. It has 
a graphical "patch cord" interface, and an elegant method for producing polyphony, compared to 
other patch-based music languages. It is particularly suitable for teaching computer music.

The Java version provides an elegant patching interface, and the C++ version can be used 
to render patches on the command line.

The most notable use of Syd to date has been to produce the a number of the sound recordings
in Bumgardner's "Whitney Music Box", which can be found at http://wheelof.com/whitney/
The patch used to render the Whitney Music Box is quite elegant in Syd, making use of
it's unusual method of producing polyphonic events.

Syd has also been used in introductory computer music classes at a few schools.
