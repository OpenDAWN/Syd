ABOUT SYD

Syd is a cross-platform instrument editor and software synthesizer by Jim Bumgardner, originally
developed in 1997, in C++.  The current version of Syd has a patching interface in Java, and a
command-line renderer written in C++.

Cyd has a graphical "patch cord" interface, and an elegant method for producing large-scale and 
recursively polyphonic patches. It is particularly suitable for teaching computer music.

USES OF SYD

The most notable use of Syd to date is in Bumgardner's "Whitney Music Box", which can be found 
at http://wheelof.com/whitney/   Syd was used for all the variations using harmonics and 
non-standard tunings.

The patch used to render the Whitney Music Box is quite elegant in Syd, making use of
it's unusual method of generating polyphony with a single "score unit".

Here are some of the Syd generated variations of the Whitney Music Box
