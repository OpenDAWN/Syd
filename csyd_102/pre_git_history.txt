First CSyd - Ported from windows version of Syd.

Most syd patches appear to be working.  Performance
is significantly better than syd.  Pluck patches
are SIGNIFICANTLY faster.

  
* Fixed ssoutput to force wave output if memory is in use,
* Fixed ssoutput to override duration and samplerate if requested.
* Added explicit WAV/AIFF override via -o

* Tested Mersenne Twister random numbers - not faster than current implementation.
